# clojure-practice

A sample of simple Clojure functions for practicing the language.

## Setup

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) - The programming language.
* [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install) - A build and project management tool.

Leiningen is all you need because it includes Clojure, but installing Clojure lets you use the language directly without setting up a project.

## Testing

* Run the main file with `lein run`

* Run tests with `lein test`
